The APP_KEY can be generated by running:
```
# If you haven't started the containers yet:
docker run --rm -it invoiceninja/invoiceninja-debian php artisan key:generate --show

# Or if your containers are already running:
docker compose exec app php artisan key:generate --show
```
Copy the entire string and insert in the .env file at APP_KEY=base64....

Start the container with:

```
docker compose up -d
```
